        one period last LDY, to set length of last eval period

The model generally expects one extra period after the last period
to be optimized for the purpose of setting the last optimization
interval length.  So, when parsing out the "middle years" in myopic mode
we need to stop gathering demands in the 2nd year when we have a 3 year 
view depth.

If the myopic view depth is 1 period, and therefore, the step can 
only be 1 period, then:
FY = LDY                (we just need data that FY period)
SY = FY + 1 period      (we are going to step 1 period)
LY = FY + 1 period      (1 period after the LDY)
